#Logic

# Conditions are met...

# Start
#Â ball starts at h
# +1 on way down

# First bounce
# bounces to h * bounce
# +1 if h * bounce > window and +1 on way down again
# break if h * bounce is <= window

# Second bounce
# bounces to h * bounce * bounce
# +1 if h * bounce * bounce > window and +1 on way down again
# break if h * bounce * bounce <= window

# Third bounce
# bounces to h * bounce * bounce * bounce
# +1 if h * bounce * bounce * bounce > window and +1 on way down again
# break if h * bounce * bounce * bounce <= window
